            We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2024 with the goal
            of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in India in
            terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the company <b>"Stockora"</b>
            which seems like a blend of two words: "Stock" and  perhaps a stylized
            suffix "ora." This could be derived from "ora," which in
            Latin means "hour" or "time." Putting it together, Stockora can be
            interpreted as "a platform for stocks in a timely or
            modern way."  
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house technology have made
            us the biggest stock broker in India.
          </p>
